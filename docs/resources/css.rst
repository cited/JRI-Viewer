CSS
**********************

The screenshots in the documentation use a Material Design CSS Extension we created.

The Material Design CSS, as well as a logo, are added during installation.

To remove these, simply delete below from /etc/webmin/authentic-theme/ directory

	style.css
	
	logo_welcome.png

In addition to making the screens a bit more vivid, it also increaes the size of objects on the page as well as padding, making it easier to work with
