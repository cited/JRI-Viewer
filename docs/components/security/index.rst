Firewalld
======================

It's important to limit the IPs that have access to your JRI instance to the database(s) being served.


InfoPage
======================

The info page shows important information and should be disabled.

Clicking the Fix Now button will disable the page in your application.properties file.


Demo Directory 
======================
The demo directory should be deleted in production environments. 


Password Encryption
======================

Clicking the button will encrypt all un-encrypted passwords in your application.properties file.

Whenever a new password is added via a Data Source, you can encrypt via this location.

 .. note::
 
   You may see an error displayed:  ERROR StatusLogger No log4j2 configuration file found. Using default configuration...
   The error is due to configuration and does not effect encryption.

ipAddressesAllowed
======================
Restrict access to JRI based on IP address

.. note::
    Each time a Data Source password is added via the Data Source tab, you will see the status for password encryption change.
